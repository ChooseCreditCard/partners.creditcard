        <h1>How Credit-Card Partner Ecosystems Actually Work</h1>
        <p class="hero-lead">
          Many loyalty cards sell the idea of “transfer partners” and “alliance access”. This page explains how
          airline and hotel partners connect to credit-card points, and what to look for before you chase a specific ecosystem.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Are Partner Ecosystems?</h2>
      <p>
        When a credit card advertises “transfer partners” or “airline &amp; hotel partners”, it usually means that
        points you earn on the card can be moved into separate loyalty programs – often at a fixed transfer ratio,
        such as 1:1 or 2:1.
      </p>
      <p>
        These ecosystems are built around alliances and long-term commercial agreements. A single card can therefore
        unlock access to flights and hotel stays across multiple brands, even if the card itself only shows one logo.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Earning with partners -->
    <section id="earning" class="section">
      <h2>Earning Points with Airlines &amp; Hotels</h2>
      <p>
        With partner-focused cards, you typically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Earn generic bank points on everyday spend.</li>
        <li>Optionally earn bonus points on travel, dining or partner purchases.</li>
        <li>Later decide which airline or hotel program to transfer those points into.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some co-branded cards skip generic points entirely and credit miles or hotel points directly into a specific program.
        These can include extras like elite-qualifying miles, night credits or partner-specific bonuses.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Redeeming via partners -->
    <section id="redeem" class="section">
      <h2>Redeeming Through Partner Programs</h2>
      <p>
        The value of partner ecosystems comes from flexibility – but also complexity. When you transfer points,
        you usually cannot reverse the transfer. You’re then locked into that airline or hotel program’s rules,
        award charts and availability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before moving points to a partner, compare:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Typical award prices for your routes or hotel regions.</li>
        <li>Taxes, surcharges and extra fees on partner bookings.</li>
        <li>Whether availability exists on the dates and cabins you actually care about.</li>
        <li>Any expiry rules – both on the bank side and in the partner program.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The best partner redemptions often involve premium cabins or long-haul travel, but they require planning
        and flexibility on dates.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- When partner ecosystems make sense -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>When Partner Ecosystems Make Sense</h2>
      <p>
        Partner ecosystems are most useful if you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Frequently fly with alliance carriers or stay in chain hotels.</li>
        <li>Are willing to learn basic award-search tools and program rules.</li>
        <li>Value premium cabin or long-stay redemptions more than cash back.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you prefer simplicity, infrequent travel or just don’t want to manage multiple programs, a simple rewards
        or cashback card may be more practical than chasing partner-specific value.
