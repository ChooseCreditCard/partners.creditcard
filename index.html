    <!-- What is a card partnership? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What is a card partnership?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        A card partnership is an agreement where multiple parties cooperate to launch, distribute or support
        a payment card. Each party brings something specific: regulation, balance sheet, technology,
        distribution or brand.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Issuer banks</strong> bring licenses, underwriting, risk and the credit line.</li>
        <li><strong>Brands and merchants</strong> bring customer relationships, loyalty programs and data.</li>
        <li><strong>Fintechs &amp; platforms</strong> bring UX, apps, onboarding and niche features.</li>
        <li><strong>Networks</strong> (Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc.) bring global acceptance and rules.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        The result is a co-branded or “powered by” product that looks like one card on the surface, but is
        actually the outcome of several tightly integrated partners behind the scenes.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How card partnerships work in practice</h2>
      <p class="small">
        While individual contracts differ, most card partnerships follow a similar logic:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Roles are defined</strong> – who is issuer of record, who owns the brand, who handles tech and support.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Economics are agreed</strong> – how interchange, annual fees, FX, interest and rewards are split.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Product is designed</strong> – target segment, credit policy, rewards structure, fees and UX.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Integration &amp; compliance</strong> – KYC, onboarding flows, disclosures and regulatory approvals.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Launch &amp; distribution</strong> – how the card is marketed: in-app, in-store, online or via partners.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Ongoing optimisation</strong> – adjusting limits, rewards, pricing and campaigns based on performance.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        For users, the partnership is mostly invisible. You see the logo on the plastic or in the app. But
        which partnerships sit behind the card can strongly affect rewards, service quality and pricing.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Common types of card partner models</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Card partnerships can be structured in many ways. Here are some of the most common patterns:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Co-branded cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            A card carries both the issuer logo and a brand: airline, hotel, retailer, sports club or
            marketplace. Rewards are often tightly linked to that partner’s ecosystem.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Affinity &amp; member cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards linked to associations, unions or communities. Benefits are tailored to member needs and
            support the organisation through revenue share.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Embedded &amp; “powered by” cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Fintech or SaaS platforms embed cards into their product (e.g. spend cards for businesses),
            while licensed issuers and BaaS providers handle the regulated parts.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>White label programs</h3>
          <p class="small">
            A full issuer and processing setup is offered as a white label solution, letting brands launch
            cards under their own name without owning the stack.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Affiliate &amp; comparison partners</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Banks and issuers partner with comparison sites, aggregators and influencers to acquire new
            customers with clear, trackable performance metrics.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Multi-partner ecosystems</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Cards that plug into a wider ecosystem of partners: lounge access, travel insurance, merchant
            offers, subscription rebates and more.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- Fees / Risks / Limits -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Fees, risks &amp; limits in partner card programs</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Partnerships do not remove costs and risk – they redistribute them. Understanding who carries what
        helps explain product design and why some cards look generous while others are conservative.
      </p>
