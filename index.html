      <h2>What Are Credit-Card Partnerships?</h2>
      <p>
        Most credit cards are the result of a partnership between several parties: a bank or issuer, a card network
        (such as Visa or Mastercard), and sometimes a brand partner like an airline, hotel group or retailer. Each
        brings something different — licensing, balance sheet, distribution, loyalty base or technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Co-brands and affinity cards use these relationships to target specific customer segments. One party may own the
        customer relationship, another handles servicing and risk, while the card network provides global acceptance and
        scheme rules.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="mechanics" class="section">
      <h2>How Partner Structures Are Put Together</h2>
      <p>
        A typical partnership starts with a commercial agreement: who issues the card, how revenue is shared, which
        benefits are funded by whom, and how long the arrangement lasts. This is then translated into card terms,
        rewards rules and operational procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the scenes, data-sharing, marketing rights and service levels are defined in detail. For example, an
        airline may handle loyalty accrual and status, while the issuer manages underwriting, billing and collections,
        and the network enforces brand and acceptance standards.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Co-Branded Cards, Affinity Cards and White-Label Setups</h2>
      <p>
        Co-branded cards carry both the issuer logo and a partner brand. Affinity cards may support a cause or
        association without deep operational integration. White-label arrangements go further, where the issuer operates
        the entire product under the partner’s visual identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For cardholders, these differences show up in how rewards are earned, which support channels are available and
        where you can manage your account. Some journeys run mostly through the partner’s app; others are handled
        through the bank’s standard tooling.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Economics, Revenue Share and Incentives</h2>
      <p>
        Partnership economics usually combine interchange revenue, annual fees, interest income, and sometimes
        marketing or data fees. The brand partner may receive compensation based on spend volume, new account openings
        or performance against agreed targets.
      </p>
      <p>
        These incentives influence how generous rewards can be, which perks are offered and whether short-term
        promotions are funded. Understanding the underlying model helps explain why some partnerships are relaunched,
        re-priced or switched to new issuers over time.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Risk, Compliance and Customer Outcomes</h2>
      <p>
        Even when a well-known brand appears on the card, the regulated issuer remains responsible for credit decisions,
        statements, collections and regulatory obligations. Complaint handling, disclosure duties and credit reporting
        follow issuer and jurisdiction rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        When partnerships change or end, card portfolios can be migrated to new products under different branding. For
        customers, this can affect rewards structures, fees and even which network the card uses — often with notice
        provided through statements and terms updates.
